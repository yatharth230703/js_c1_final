// var was used in the es5 version of javascript
// let and const introduced in the es6 version which was newer. COnst is well , in its name ,constant
//primary difference between var and let is that var is function scope,d this means that I can initialize var anywhere in my code and use it anywhere , so within a function , no concept of local/global
//let works like noraml variables in other programming languages
